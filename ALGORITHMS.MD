**Brainstorming Potential Algorithms**

Look at all potential moves for next n moves (4^n possibilities).
Evaluate "best" move out of those 4^n possibilities?

Ideas on how to find best move:
1. Current Score (Not ideal)
2. Minimize sum of 4 \* 4th row squares + 3 \* 3rd row squares + ... (better to have big numbers in top row)

Finish Algorithm
Make function to get array of numbers
